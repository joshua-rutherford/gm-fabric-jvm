# PROLOG

This product is a microservice framework for the JVM and is intended to be built upon and extended. We have made an initial release of the source code, and continue to work actively to make it better. We hope to build an active open source community that drives the future of this framework, both by providing feedback and by actively contributing to the source code.

# gm-fabric-jvm ( gmf )
---

This project is built on top of Twitters Finagle and Finatra libraries. The core functionality resides in finagle-core and finatra-http and has been abstracted from the developer.

This project has two modules core and archetype. The core module has the underlying business logic that abstracts the Thrift and RESTful capabilities from the developer. The archetype module is used to build out a microservice.

A microservice ( MS ) is composed of four modules defined in the table below.
	
| Module | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| business | Shared business logic either written in scala or java. |
| client | Thrift client and test coverage. |
| model | Thrift model. |
| server | REST and Thrift endpoints. |
